Program Specification
For this program, you will be performing operations on arrays. 
The assignment contains many subtasks. You are expected to individually solve the subtasks using functions. 
The operation performed depends on the user choice. For the different choices entered by the user, perform the corresponding operations.

To get the user choice, you need to display the following prompt:

	Welcome!
	1) Feed array input
	2) Determine the minimum element in the array
	3) Determine the maximum element in the array
	4) Sort the array of integers
	5) Determine the average of the elements in the array
	6) Randomly generate array elements within a specific range
	7) Print the elements of the array
	8) Exit program
	Enter your choice: 
	
If the user doesn't enter an integer choice that falls in the specified range, then prompt them again. 
It can be assured that the input for this prompt will be integers only. 
The input will be valid numbers and you need not check for invalid input types to this program."
